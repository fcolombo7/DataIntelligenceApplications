    "This report aims to give an overview of the steps conducted to reach the goal of modelling the following given scenario: consider the scenario in which advertisement is used to attract users on an ecommerce website and the users, after the purchase of the first unit of a consumable item, will buy additional units of the same item in future. We will walk through the description of the specific scenario we have studied and the design choices we adopted in order to yield the optimal solution for our obejctive: to find the best joint bidding and pricing strategy.\n"

    "## 1.Scenario\n",
    "The real world scenario we chose to model is the exploitation of online advertising to enhance the incomes of a **coffee** seller and the consequent choice of the best price for each class of costumer. For the sake of simiplicity the costumers of the coffee website are supposed to be categorized based on a feature space described by to 2 binary features:\n",

    "The table above shows the 3 sub-categories that distinguish the customers:\n",
    "* **C1**: customers used to buy online and that consume coffee on a daily basis\n",
    "* **C2**: class that includes two kinds of customers since they behave in a similar manner, that is the every day consumers that are not very accostumed to buy online and the customers that drink coffee less frequently but that buy often online\n",
    "* **C3**: hard customers that are not used to buy online and that drink coffee less frequently than every day consumers\n",

    "* a stochastic **number of daily clicks** of new users as a function depending on the bid;\n",
    "* a stochastic **cost per click** as a function of the bid;\n",
    "* a **conversion rate** function providing the probability that a user will buy the item given a price;\n",
    "* a distribution probability over the **number of times the user will come back** to the ecommerce website to buy that item by **30 days** after the first purchase.\n",

    "## 2. Model formalization\n",
    "Once we have described the scenario in which we are going to work, we need to formalize in a mathematical fashion which is our goal, how we want to achieve it and the variables that come into play.<br> \n",
    "### 2a. Assumptions\n",
    "1. Every price available is associated with a margin obtained by the sale that is known beforehand. Without loss of generality we assume to have a fixed cost for the coffee production and so to use directly the margin for the pricing process<br>\n",
    "2. The price _p_ for a given costumers is fixed for any future purchases<br>\n",
    "3. If a customer visit again the website after a first purchase, he/she will surely buy the item again<br>\n",
    "4. Ther is no budget constraint<br>\n",
    "5. Auctions are not included in the modelling of the scenario nor simulated<br>\n",
    "6. Every sub-campaign is asssociated with a given class of customer (i.e. context)<br>\n",
    "7. The considered time horizon is of 1 year\n",

    "### 2b. Offline setting\n",
    "In this section the problem is formulated by mean of an objective function followed by the formalization of an algortihm to solve it. Here we make a further **assumption** of working in an **offline setting**: the values of the parameters of the problem are known. Before stating the function, the parameters with their descriptions and the notations are given in the table below.\n",

    "\n",
    "The values of all the parameters are known and available in $\\Theta(1)$, given the assummption of an offline setting.  \n",
    "Defining $X$ the total number of bids and $P$ the total number of prices, the algorithm finds the optimal values $p_{j,t}^{*}, x_{j,t}^{*}$ with time complexity: $$ \\Theta(T \\text{ } N \\text{ } X \\text{ } P) $$\n",

    "### 2c. Online setting\n",
    "Once the offline version of the model has been formalized and the scenario depicted, the scope of the project resides the most in solving a real case scenario that is best modelled by an **online setting**. Here we remove the previous assumption of knowing beforhand all the parameters of the distributions. This means that we have to find the best values for the price and bid, **without having full knowledge of the distributions** governing our variables. To find an approximation of the variables we have to sample values from the environment and build an increasingly-better estimation of the underlying distribution.\n",
    "Each day is considered a different \"round\" of our problem and, as previously stated, we consider a time horizon of 1 year.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Random Variables\n",
    "In this section we list the variables of which we do not have full knowledge. These variables will be sampled at each round from a distribution in the environment. \n",
    "\n",

    "| $\\tau_{j}$| The number of times the user buys again is sampled from a distr. after the first purchase |\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling from a variable means extracting a value from a distribution with the chosen parameter.\n",
    "In particular when sampling from the Conversion Rate, we sample from a Bernoulli distribution. Meanwhile, when sampling from the CPC, the number of new users and the number of future purchases we sample from a Gaussian distribution with the chosen mean and variance parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Delays\n",
    "The anlysis of the problem lead also to consider potential delays in the feedbacks. <br>\n",
    "The delay that can be considered in the given scenario is that the subsequent buys from the same user are not considered instantaneous but delayed by a certain time. For the sake of simplicity, we considered the time to be fixed to 30 days, but it can also be implemented as a random variable where the delay sampled from a probability distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Delay | Description |\n",
    "|---------:|:------------|\n",
    "| $\\alpha_{j}$| Delay in acquiring item again  | \n",
    "\n",
    "To cope with the delay issue we have chosen to draw a sample from a Gaussian distribution each time a user buy the coffee on the website. This sample represents the number of time the user will come back to buy the item again. After 30 rounds from the purchase, the income of the future purchases is added to the reward linked to the strategy chosen by the algorithm in order to update the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2d. Algorithm\n",
    "To solve the online optimization problem we use a MAB approach.\n",
    "In the MAB approach the objective is to minimize the regret, defined as the cumulative difference between the reward of the clairvoyant algorithm, which always chooses the optimal arm $\\mu^*$, and the reward given by the arm which we choose at a specific round $\\mu$.<br> \n",
    "Each arm is described by a given value that depends on the problem we are trying to solve: \n",
    "- a bid value in case of advertising problem\n",
    "- a price value for a pricing problem\n",
